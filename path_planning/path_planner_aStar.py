# Path Planner with A* algorith

#######################################################
#################### Assumptions ######################
#######################################################

# - the starting position is the center position of the map, one layer above.
# - the A* algorithm starts at the min total cost location in the first row
# - the first step the person can take is directly in front of them or
#	the diagonal in front of them 
# - the first row of the list is the first step someone will take.
# - 0 in a map represents free space
# - 1 in a map represents an obstacle
# - User can more straight, diagonal left, or diagonal right 
# - in the path planner, the cost given to a 
#	straight motion is 1 and the cost given to diagonal motions is 2
# - if there is no path available, the planner will return []
# - the planner also needs to return the size of the map (just width)
# - the graph generator adds additional costs if there are obstacles
#	near the position you are calculating the cost for.

#######################################################
################## Things to Add ######################
#######################################################
# - if there is a row filled with obstacles and the goal 
#	is behind the row of obstacles then pass back an empty
#	path or should we pass back a path that gets you closest
#	to it?
# - need to add an algorithm for finding the goal location
#	if it isn't provided by the mapping team. Need to find the
#	farthest free location.
# - add error check. If the get_neighbors of idxNBest is
#	then return the current path. This basically means
#	there are obstacles preventing you from moving 
#	forwards
